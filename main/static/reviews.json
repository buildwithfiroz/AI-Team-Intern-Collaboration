The performance is top-notch; it doesn’t feel like an Air at all. Apple has really nailed it with the M-series silicon chips.The 13-inch screen is perfect for me—light and portable. You won’t feel like the screen is too small. I also own a Lenovo Legion with a 15.6-inch display, and I find the MacBook's display to be very impressive. Despite what some online comments say, I don’t notice any issues with the 60Hz refresh rate.My main use case is coding—both web and app development. The MacBook performs flawlessly. Build times are very short, and Android Studio runs smoothly.One thing to note: since it doesn’t have a fan, it can get warm when multiple apps are open. But overall, I highly recommend it without hesitation. I’ll provide an update after using it for a month.",
